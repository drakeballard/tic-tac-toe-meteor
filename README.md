# Tic, Tac, Toe - using Meteor

This application was a tutorial to familairize myself with [Meteor](https://meteor.com) to buld JavaScript applications. 

This tutorial was based on an article that I read from Paul Orac. If you want to review his article please visit the following website on [Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/building-multiplayer-tictactoe-game-with-meteor/).

5. Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) which will spin up the application.
